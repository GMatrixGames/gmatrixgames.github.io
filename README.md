# Welcome!

My name is Garrett. I develop programs and utilities for games I enjoy. I am also a college student working on a Bachelor's Degree in Game Development!

I have worked extensively in C#, C++, Java, and TypeScript. I am also proficient in Unity and Unreal Engine.
I make things that help and are used by others. Making games or game-related things is my happy place.
